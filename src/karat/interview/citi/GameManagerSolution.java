/*
We are building the back-end for an online gaming platform. The system tracks
players and their match history. Each match result records the outcome from
that player's perspective.

Definitions:
* A "player" has: playerId, username.
* A "match result" has: playerId, opponentId, outcome, score, timestamp.
* Outcome is one of: WIN, LOSS, DRAW.
* "GameManager" manages players and match results and provides player statistics.

To begin with, we present you with two tasks:
1-1) Read through and understand the code below. Feel free to run it.
1-2) The test for GameManager is not passing due to a bug in the code.
     Make the necessary changes to GameManager to fix the bug.
*/

/*
We are extending the platform to support recording match results
and computing per-player score statistics.

Each MatchResult represents one player's experience of a single match:
- playerId      : the player this record belongs to
- opponentId    : the opponent in that match
- outcome        : one of WIN, LOSS, DRAW
- score          : the player's score in that match
- timestamp      : when the match was played

To implement these changes, we need to add two functions to the GameManager class:

2.1) The addMatchResult function should be used to store a match result.
     If the playerId on the match result does not refer to a known player
     in GameManager, the match result should be ignored.

2.2) The getAverageScoreByOutcome function should return a dictionary
     mapping each outcome (WIN, LOSS, DRAW) to the player's average score
     for that outcome. Only outcomes the player has at least one result
     for should appear in the dictionary. If the player has no match
     results at all, return an empty dictionary.

To assist you in testing these new functions, we have provided the
testAddMatchResult and testGetAverageScoreByOutcome tests.
